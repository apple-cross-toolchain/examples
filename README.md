# Apple cross-compiling toolchain examples
Examples of using Apple cross-compiling toolchain to build apps and frameworks for Apple on non-Apple platforms.

See [the GitHub Actions workflows settings](.github/workflows/build.yml) on how to build examples.

See the GitHub Actions summary to download build artifacts. Note: macOS apps are unsigned so you will need to disable Gatekeeper
in order to run them.
